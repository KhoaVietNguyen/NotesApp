The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✅] User can set username.
- [✅] User can view a list of note currently.
- [✅] User can create new post.
- [✅] User can check notes list of another user.

- Use swiftUI, realtime firebase database, use MVVM pattern to base code structure.
- It takes a lot of time to research the property of swiftUI
